### A Learning Guide to GraphQL (graphql-python)

#### Hey there!
Welcome to my journey with GraphQL with Python. Want to learn the unconventional way, follow along as each step is broken down for better understanding.
For conventional users [learn here](https://www.howtographql.com/) the process is relatively easy.

### Technologies
##### Check out their beginners guide if you're new to them
1. Python - (( [Python guide](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) ))
2. Django - (( [Django guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/) ))
3. [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/) and [Graphene-Django](http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/)

### Here are the applications we will need. 
1. Insomnia (As we proceed in the course (User Authentication section) you will get a better understanding of this)

## GraphQL - Introduction
GraphQL means **Graph Query Language.**
A Query Language (just like SQL) GraphQL -  is a language for writing standardized data query.
It is basically used to retrieve/request information.
Example of a GraphQL Query
> query { 
>   h3 { 
>     p 
>     }
>  }

There are two main operations in GraphQL which are the **query** and **mutation**
The **query** requests for information while the **mutation** sends information (This will be properly illustrated as we progress)
